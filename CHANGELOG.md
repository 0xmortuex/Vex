# Changelog

## v2.1.0 (2026-06-12) — Peek, Skills, Boosts, Handoff & Passwords

### Added
- **Peek** — Shift+click any link to preview it in a floating overlay; Esc dismisses, Ctrl+Enter (or one click) promotes it to a real tab.
- **AI Skills** — saved, reusable AI commands ("Summarize in 5 bullets", "Explain like I'm 5", …) that run on the current page from the command bar; create your own in Settings → AI Skills.
- **Boosts** — per-site customization: **Zap Element** (Ctrl+K) hides any element forever on that site; **Boost This Site** opens a custom CSS/JS editor. Managed in Settings → Boosts.
- **Send to Phone / Handoff** — push the current tab to your other Vex devices via the sync worker (Ctrl+K → "Send to Phone"); tabs sent from Vex Mobile open here automatically. Requires Vex Sync sign-in.
- **Password manager** — Vex offers to save logins as you sign in, autofills them on return visits, and lists them in Settings → Passwords. Encrypted at rest with the OS keychain (safeStorage/DPAPI); never-save list per site.

## v2.0.5 (2026-06-12) — Settings glow-up & customizable sidebar

### Added
- **Customizable sidebar buttons** — right-click a service icon (Claude / WhatsApp / Spotify) to **Rename**, **Change icon** (15-icon picker), **Change link**, **Delete (hide)**, or **Reset**. Claude can one-click **Switch to Claude / Gemini / ChatGPT**. Customizations persist across launches.

### Changed
- **Settings redesign** — the flat list is now vivid, color-coded **category cards** with icons, a sticky category nav to jump between sections, and livelier toggles/inputs/buttons. All existing settings and handlers are unchanged.

## v2.0.4 (2026-06-12) — Guided tour

### Added
- **Interactive tour** — a spotlight walkthrough that highlights every control (address bar, vertical tabs, workspaces, command bar, AI agent, split screen…) with tooltips and Back / Next / Skip. Offered automatically on first run; replay anytime via `Ctrl+K` → "Tour".
