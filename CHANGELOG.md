# Changelog

## v2.10.0 (2026-06-12) — MCP client

### Added
- **MCP Servers** (Settings → MCP Servers, or Ctrl+K → "MCP Servers & Tools") — connect Vex to **Model Context Protocol** servers over HTTP. Add a server (URL + optional bearer token), Vex performs the MCP handshake and lists the server's tools, and a built-in **explorer** lets you pick a tool, fill in JSON arguments (pre-skeletoned from the tool's input schema), and run it — seeing the result inline. JSON-RPC traffic is proxied through Vex so there are no CORS limits, and both plain-JSON and SSE responses are handled.
- Scope note: this is a standalone MCP client/explorer; wiring MCP tools into the autonomous agent is a planned follow-up, kept separate so the stable agent is untouched.

## v2.9.0 (2026-06-12) — On-device AI (WebGPU)

### Added
- **On-Device AI** (Settings → On-Device AI, or Ctrl+K → "On-Device AI") — run a small LLM **entirely on your machine** via WebGPU: private, offline, no server. Pick a model (Llama 3.2 1B/3B, Qwen 2.5 1.5B, Phi 3.5 mini), press **Download & load** (weights download once and cache), and flip on "Use on-device AI for chat & summaries". Chat / summarize / explain / translate then run locally; agent & multi-tab still use cloud.
- Fully opt-in and safe: nothing downloads until you ask, WebGPU is feature-detected (the option explains itself if your device lacks it), and the router **falls back to cloud/Ollama automatically** if on-device isn't ready or errors. Your model choice is remembered.

## v2.8.0 (2026-06-12) — Cross-site tracker insights

### Added
- **"Following you across sites"** in the Privacy Report (Ctrl+K → "Privacy Report") — Vex now records *which of your sites* each blocked tracker appeared on, and surfaces the ones seen on multiple sites: the companies actually following you around the web, ranked by reach, with the site list. Turns the raw block count into a real privacy picture (Ghostery/Disconnect-style).

## v2.7.0 (2026-06-12) — Persistent AI memory

### Added
- **AI Memory** (Settings → AI Memory) — tell Vex facts and preferences to keep in mind in *every* chat: your name, role, tone ("answer concisely"), languages, tech stack, location… They're injected as context on each AI request, so the assistant stops forgetting who you are between sessions.
- **Remember a fact** (Ctrl+K → "AI: Remember a Fact") — jot a memory from anywhere without opening settings.
- Works on **both** the local (Ollama) and cloud backends — no worker change needed — and is purely additive (never overrides your persona or the default prompt). Memory is per-device but **syncs across your devices** when Vex Sync is on. Toggle it off anytime; nothing is sent until you add a fact.

## v2.6.0 (2026-06-12) — Developer & power tools

### Added
- **API client** (Ctrl+K → "API Client") — a built-in REST client: pick a method, set headers and a body, hit Send, and browse the response as a collapsible, syntax-coloured JSON tree (or raw text). CORS-free (runs in main, like curl); shows status, time, and size.
- **Format JSON** (Ctrl+K → "Format JSON") — turn the current raw-JSON tab into the same collapsible tree.
- **Responsive Preview** (Ctrl+K → "Responsive Preview") — see the current page side-by-side at iPhone SE / iPhone 14 / iPad / laptop / desktop widths in one overlay, with reload-all. Polypane-lite for checking responsive layouts.
- **Watch This Page** (Ctrl+K) — Vex periodically refetches a page, strips it to text, and **alerts you when it changes** (restocks, docs, status pages, listings). Manage everything in **Watched Pages**; optional OS notifications. Each watch runs on its own interval.
- **Wayback archiving** — "Save to Wayback Machine" preserves the current page on web.archive.org; "View Archived Version" (also on right-click → links) opens the latest snapshot to recover dead/changed links.

## v2.5.0 (2026-06-12) — Privacy hardening pack

### Added
- **Fingerprint protection** (Settings → Privacy Hardening, default off) — Brave-style "farbling" injects tiny, per-session, imperceptible noise into the canvas / WebGL / audio readouts that tracking scripts hash to fingerprint you, and normalizes `hardwareConcurrency` / `deviceMemory` / GPU strings. The noise is consistent within a session (sites still work) but changes every launch, so you can't be silently linked across sites or over time. Applies to pages opened after toggling.
- **DNS-over-HTTPS** (Settings → Privacy Hardening, default off) — encrypt your DNS lookups via Cloudflare, Google, or Quad9. *Opportunistic* (safe, falls back to system DNS) or *Strict* (DoH only). Applies browser-wide immediately via Chromium's secure resolver.
- **Privacy Report** (Ctrl+K → "Privacy Report", or the button in Settings) — a live shield showing how many trackers/ads were blocked this session, the top blocked domains, and your fingerprint + DNS protection status. Reset counters anytime.
- The existing ad/tracker blocker now **tallies** what it stops so the report has real numbers.

## v2.4.0 (2026-06-12) — Reading pack: highlights, recall & accessibility

### Added
- **Persistent highlights** — select text on any page and highlight it (Ctrl+K → "Highlight", or right-click → Highlight; yellow/green/pink). Highlights are stored locally per-URL and **reappear every time you revisit the page**. Add a note to any highlight. New **Highlights** sidebar panel lists every highlight across all pages, grouped by page, with a count badge.
- **Recall ("memex")** — full-text search of everything you've read. As you browse, the readable text of each page is indexed locally (capped, stored in `userData/recall.json`, never uploaded). The new **Recall** sidebar panel finds any page by its *content* — "that paragraph about DPI throttling" — not just its title. Off-the-record/container/file pages are never indexed. Toggle + clear in Settings → Recall.
- **Reading & Accessibility pack** (Settings → Reading & Accessibility), applied to every page:
  - **Dyslexia-friendly fonts** — Lexend, Atkinson Hyperlegible, OpenDyslexic.
  - **Color-vision filters** — protanopia / deuteranopia / tritanopia simulation + grayscale (feColorMatrix).
  - **Reading ruler** — a translucent bar that follows your cursor to keep your place.
  - **Bionic Reading** (Ctrl+K) — bolds the start of each word to speed reading; run again to undo.
  - **Speed Read / RSVP** (Ctrl+K) — flashes the article one word at a time at an adjustable 150–900 WPM.
  - **Translate Selection** (Ctrl+K) — translate highlighted text into your language inline.

## v2.3.2 (2026-06-12) — Adaptive memory guard

### Added
- **Memory guard** (Settings → Performance) — when total browser memory crosses a ceiling (default 1.2 GB), Vex sleeps the least-recently-used background tabs (never the active or pinned ones) until back under. Light sessions are untouched; heavy ones stay capped, keeping Vex near its floor without disrupting normal use. Off / 0.9 / 1.2 / 1.6 / 2.4 GB.

## v2.3.1 (2026-06-12) — Lazy session restore (big memory win)

### Changed
- **Lazy session restore** — on launch, only the focused tab loads a webview; the rest of your saved session restores as lightweight placeholders (title + favicon) and materializes the instant you click them. On a real session this cut startup memory by ~60% (≈950 MB → ≈390 MB private). Sleeping tabs and tab groups are unaffected; auto-sleep skips not-yet-loaded tabs.

## v2.3.0 (2026-06-12) — Library, AI tab commands & the works

### Added
- **Read Later / Library** — save pages to a queue (Ctrl+K → "Read Later"), unread badge on the new Library sidebar panel; opening marks read.
- **Auto-archive** — tabs untouched for N days (Settings → Library) close into the Library archive instead of rotting open.
- **Clip to Notes** — selected text (or the page link) saved into a pinned "Clippings" note with source + date.
- **AI Tab Commands** — "close all YouTube tabs", "group my shopping tabs": AI plans, you confirm, it applies.
- **Now Playing** — a mini bar for tabs making sound: play/pause, mute, jump-to-tab.
- **Pin Site to Sidebar** — keep any site as a Vivaldi-style web panel (right-click its icon to unpin).
- **Off-the-Record tab** — ephemeral tab: no history, cookies vanish on close.
- **Boss key** — Ctrl+Alt+H hides + mutes every Vex window instantly; again to restore.
- **Reverse-image search** — right-click any image → Search with Google Lens / copy / open.
- **QR code** — Ctrl+K → "QR Code" to open the current page on your phone.
- **Per-tab volume** — tab right-click → "Page volume…".
- **Resource Monitor** — live CPU/memory per browser process.
- **Quick slots** — Ctrl+Alt+1/2/3 run your first three command chains.
- **Ambient grouping** — links opened from a grouped tab join that group automatically.

## v2.2.0 (2026-06-12) — Focus, gestures, bookmarks, feeds & more

### Added
- **Focus Mode** — Ctrl+K → "Focus 25/50": hides all chrome and blocks distracting sites (editable blocklist in Settings → Focus) for the session.
- **Compact Mode** — collapse both sidebars for maximum page space (persists).
- **Mouse gestures** — hold right button and drag: ← back, → forward, ↑ top, ↓ reload, ↓→ close tab, ↓← reopen.
- **Bookmarks** — ☆ in the URL bar + a Bookmarks sidebar panel with folders and search.
- **Feeds (RSS)** — a minimal, algorithm-free feed reader panel.
- **Read Aloud** — text-to-speech for the current article.
- **AI Compose** — AI writes/rewrites text straight into the focused input on the page.
- **Command Chains** — run several command-bar actions as one command (Settings → Command Chains).
- **Container tabs** — Work/Personal/Shopping tabs with isolated cookies (log into two accounts at once).
- **Cookie-banner auto-hide** — major consent walls are hidden and scroll unlocked (toggle in Settings).
- **Screenshot annotation** — pen/box/arrow editor on captured screenshots.
- Sync worker: no-email dev fallback for sign-in (returns the code when RESEND_API_KEY is absent).

## v2.1.0 (2026-06-12) — Peek, Skills, Boosts, Handoff & Passwords

### Added
- **Peek** — Shift+click any link to preview it in a floating overlay; Esc dismisses, Ctrl+Enter (or one click) promotes it to a real tab.
- **AI Skills** — saved, reusable AI commands ("Summarize in 5 bullets", "Explain like I'm 5", …) that run on the current page from the command bar; create your own in Settings → AI Skills.
- **Boosts** — per-site customization: **Zap Element** (Ctrl+K) hides any element forever on that site; **Boost This Site** opens a custom CSS/JS editor. Managed in Settings → Boosts.
- **Send to Phone / Handoff** — push the current tab to your other Vex devices via the sync worker (Ctrl+K → "Send to Phone"); tabs sent from Vex Mobile open here automatically. Requires Vex Sync sign-in.
- **Password manager** — Vex offers to save logins as you sign in, autofills them on return visits, and lists them in Settings → Passwords. Encrypted at rest with the OS keychain (safeStorage/DPAPI); never-save list per site.

## v2.0.5 (2026-06-12) — Settings glow-up & customizable sidebar

### Added
- **Customizable sidebar buttons** — right-click a service icon (Claude / WhatsApp / Spotify) to **Rename**, **Change icon** (15-icon picker), **Change link**, **Delete (hide)**, or **Reset**. Claude can one-click **Switch to Claude / Gemini / ChatGPT**. Customizations persist across launches.

### Changed
- **Settings redesign** — the flat list is now vivid, color-coded **category cards** with icons, a sticky category nav to jump between sections, and livelier toggles/inputs/buttons. All existing settings and handlers are unchanged.

## v2.0.4 (2026-06-12) — Guided tour

### Added
- **Interactive tour** — a spotlight walkthrough that highlights every control (address bar, vertical tabs, workspaces, command bar, AI agent, split screen…) with tooltips and Back / Next / Skip. Offered automatically on first run; replay anytime via `Ctrl+K` → "Tour".
