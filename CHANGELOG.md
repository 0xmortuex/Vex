# Changelog

## v2.3.1 (2026-06-12) — Lazy session restore (big memory win)

### Changed
- **Lazy session restore** — on launch, only the focused tab loads a webview; the rest of your saved session restores as lightweight placeholders (title + favicon) and materializes the instant you click them. On a real session this cut startup memory by ~60% (≈950 MB → ≈390 MB private). Sleeping tabs and tab groups are unaffected; auto-sleep skips not-yet-loaded tabs.

## v2.3.0 (2026-06-12) — Library, AI tab commands & the works

### Added
- **Read Later / Library** — save pages to a queue (Ctrl+K → "Read Later"), unread badge on the new Library sidebar panel; opening marks read.
- **Auto-archive** — tabs untouched for N days (Settings → Library) close into the Library archive instead of rotting open.
- **Clip to Notes** — selected text (or the page link) saved into a pinned "Clippings" note with source + date.
- **AI Tab Commands** — "close all YouTube tabs", "group my shopping tabs": AI plans, you confirm, it applies.
- **Now Playing** — a mini bar for tabs making sound: play/pause, mute, jump-to-tab.
- **Pin Site to Sidebar** — keep any site as a Vivaldi-style web panel (right-click its icon to unpin).
- **Off-the-Record tab** — ephemeral tab: no history, cookies vanish on close.
- **Boss key** — Ctrl+Alt+H hides + mutes every Vex window instantly; again to restore.
- **Reverse-image search** — right-click any image → Search with Google Lens / copy / open.
- **QR code** — Ctrl+K → "QR Code" to open the current page on your phone.
- **Per-tab volume** — tab right-click → "Page volume…".
- **Resource Monitor** — live CPU/memory per browser process.
- **Quick slots** — Ctrl+Alt+1/2/3 run your first three command chains.
- **Ambient grouping** — links opened from a grouped tab join that group automatically.

## v2.2.0 (2026-06-12) — Focus, gestures, bookmarks, feeds & more

### Added
- **Focus Mode** — Ctrl+K → "Focus 25/50": hides all chrome and blocks distracting sites (editable blocklist in Settings → Focus) for the session.
- **Compact Mode** — collapse both sidebars for maximum page space (persists).
- **Mouse gestures** — hold right button and drag: ← back, → forward, ↑ top, ↓ reload, ↓→ close tab, ↓← reopen.
- **Bookmarks** — ☆ in the URL bar + a Bookmarks sidebar panel with folders and search.
- **Feeds (RSS)** — a minimal, algorithm-free feed reader panel.
- **Read Aloud** — text-to-speech for the current article.
- **AI Compose** — AI writes/rewrites text straight into the focused input on the page.
- **Command Chains** — run several command-bar actions as one command (Settings → Command Chains).
- **Container tabs** — Work/Personal/Shopping tabs with isolated cookies (log into two accounts at once).
- **Cookie-banner auto-hide** — major consent walls are hidden and scroll unlocked (toggle in Settings).
- **Screenshot annotation** — pen/box/arrow editor on captured screenshots.
- Sync worker: no-email dev fallback for sign-in (returns the code when RESEND_API_KEY is absent).

## v2.1.0 (2026-06-12) — Peek, Skills, Boosts, Handoff & Passwords

### Added
- **Peek** — Shift+click any link to preview it in a floating overlay; Esc dismisses, Ctrl+Enter (or one click) promotes it to a real tab.
- **AI Skills** — saved, reusable AI commands ("Summarize in 5 bullets", "Explain like I'm 5", …) that run on the current page from the command bar; create your own in Settings → AI Skills.
- **Boosts** — per-site customization: **Zap Element** (Ctrl+K) hides any element forever on that site; **Boost This Site** opens a custom CSS/JS editor. Managed in Settings → Boosts.
- **Send to Phone / Handoff** — push the current tab to your other Vex devices via the sync worker (Ctrl+K → "Send to Phone"); tabs sent from Vex Mobile open here automatically. Requires Vex Sync sign-in.
- **Password manager** — Vex offers to save logins as you sign in, autofills them on return visits, and lists them in Settings → Passwords. Encrypted at rest with the OS keychain (safeStorage/DPAPI); never-save list per site.

## v2.0.5 (2026-06-12) — Settings glow-up & customizable sidebar

### Added
- **Customizable sidebar buttons** — right-click a service icon (Claude / WhatsApp / Spotify) to **Rename**, **Change icon** (15-icon picker), **Change link**, **Delete (hide)**, or **Reset**. Claude can one-click **Switch to Claude / Gemini / ChatGPT**. Customizations persist across launches.

### Changed
- **Settings redesign** — the flat list is now vivid, color-coded **category cards** with icons, a sticky category nav to jump between sections, and livelier toggles/inputs/buttons. All existing settings and handlers are unchanged.

## v2.0.4 (2026-06-12) — Guided tour

### Added
- **Interactive tour** — a spotlight walkthrough that highlights every control (address bar, vertical tabs, workspaces, command bar, AI agent, split screen…) with tooltips and Back / Next / Skip. Offered automatically on first run; replay anytime via `Ctrl+K` → "Tour".
